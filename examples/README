To regenerate the ML-DSA private and public keys in *.priv and *.pub run

    go run generate.go

The prettified versions are created with

    ./pretty

Requires der-ascii:

    go install github.com/google/der-ascii/cmd/...@latest

The certificates are generated with a ad-hoc modified fork of Go:
